    <h1>About Schemas.Pub</h1>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p>
        Schemas.pub is a pilot project of the <a href="https://dtinit.org">Data
        Transfer Initiative</a>, built and hosted to promote interoperability
        and consistency of data exchange, especially for personal data transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are some data types we exchange over the Internet quite frequently
        and successfully: calendar items, tasks and contacts for example. The
        standards for
        <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2445">calendar items</a>
        and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2425">contacts</a>
        were written in 1998, and since then, similar standards are not very
        common.
        If you take a look at those standards, they use a distinct data format,
        which
        made them a lot more work to define.
      </p>
      <p>Since then, JSON and XML have made basic data formatting much more
        interoperable
        and schema languages for those formats have emerged. <a
            href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema
        </a> and other schema languages for JSON can quickly and easily show
        what
        some data consumer expects in a particular data file, and
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/">XML Schema Definition
          Language</a> does the same for XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why has the emergence of such widespread data format standards and
        schema
        languages
        not made it <i>easier</i> to define a standard? Why do we have no widely
        interoperable standard for "an online photo album"
        or "a restaurant reservation"? Instead of making it easier to
        define standards, XML/JSON and schema languages have encouraged the
        proliferation of "unilateral" data definitions -- Web APIs with schemas
        defined unilaterally by the designer and host
        of that API. Thus, pretty much every service that hosts
        common data (like digital photos in albums, or restaurant info and
        reservation data!) uses different schemas.
        (Sometimes parts of these APIs use <a
          href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>,
        which is great and helps a lot with consistency, accessibility, and
        internationalization of individual fields.)
      </p>

      <p> Is this really a problem? In practice consumers of APIs just
        translate API data into their own format, sometimes aided by schema
        definitions and sometimes not. Yet, we think this could be made
        somewhat better by allowing organizations to publish schemas that
        have some real thought behind them, alongside tools for using
        and applying those schemas, and reputational markers to show which
        data schemas have implementations, interoperability, open licenses
        or standards governance. We welcome your thoughts.
      </p>

      <p> The pilot version of schemas.pub is a fraction of the functionality
        and registry size that we envision eventually. We're building the site
        as we learn about what's most useful to publishers of schemas
        as well as implementers searching for solid information. We think
        persistent URLs for schemas are difficult but useful and if
        your organization could use persistent URLs for stable schemas,
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yPMuDri2VLWdv0WW6gj_GPA7xOSg-Nqc7_nfTJmabQg"
        >contact us</a>.
      </p>

      <p>To get started, search for a schema you're interested in and see
        how it's defined, some examples, and how it's implemented. If you have
        a schema you think should be listed, <a
            href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">create an account and add it.</a>
